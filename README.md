## Currently Working On

I'm making stepping stone steps to fully realizing **Abraxas**, a gnostic game I've envisioned for years from studying archetypes and religion and traveling the earth. I have the game laid out in my mind, and now I'm working on delivering the vision to a digital, readable, and shareable form.  but I use other projects to develop abilities to build abraxas right.  so technically i am not even ready to break ground outside the countless hours and weeks and months and years I spent building it thusfar.

Despite facing financial struggles and coming from a background of poverty, I'm committed to this project. I'm not connected to many people; it's just my girlfriend and mom and a handful of friends in my life. I don't relate to corporate professionals with steady careers because I have none. I make it on my own, working as hard as possible with what I have. I often have to abandon computer science to do manual labor and save up so I can continue coding and support the habit.

**Abraxas** is something indescribable‚Äîa full disclosure on archeoastronomy contexts to our modern culture, everything.  there are these old egyptian riddles and I believe you have to know the full story to see how they are solved, and I hope to be the storyteller on all that. I'm a religious studies major, the religious history and social engineering humans to our current programming, yeah im totally obsessed, and I've broken down the stars and ancient stories. I'm decoding computer science to transmit this knowledge, which even scholars seem blind to.  but meanwhile I am pretty versatile with computers if anyone is looking for a team mate I am cheap.

My intuition led me to this unique angle, and Abraxas is no joke. It's a chess variant star map game with an accompanying encyclopedia, which I already wrote but am not ready to share until it's complete and ties in with the game.  which i honestly cant even describe its just really novel is all i can say.

I've built **Oddpepes** oddpepes.xyz on polygon as a placeholder for what's to come, learning from each project and adding to my arsenal. Currently, I'm on the stepping stone of programmatically directing AI to generate innovative content. I've developed a core framework for extremely useful prograde content, customized and delivered quickly. The result is mind-bending, and now I'm using Godot to create layers for this core.

These layers will read, display, and allow controlled interactions with the core, making the experience playable like a game. This core can also be used in various media modes, embodying Marshall McLuhan's idea that "the medium is the message."

I've dedicated much of my life to elite firefighting, which paid the bills but took a toll on my body. Now, as an older me, I need to develop skills that don't require physical strain and so much salty dog league shit. Coding has been my inclination since I was 12, I was coding AIML chatbots in high school.  

I'm also a private composer of chiptunes, available on Spotify.

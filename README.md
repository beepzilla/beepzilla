- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @beepzilla
IÂ´m an ex type 1 wildland firefighter that decided to start coding instead of firefighting a few years ago and never looked back.  I coded as a kid so i kinda just know how to code basically.  a pepe friend on the other side of the world and i were casually dabbling in new applications of technologies and i started building this stuff out and now we have oddpeps and kekels and now burgers cuz why not.  IÂ´ve been in 3D generation research for some years and have to thank threestudio for their constant breakthroughs.  the current state of technologies, made a simple idea into a web3 reality, offering an interesting demo of things that are possible for inspiriation for future fintech projects to come(I am for hire, talk to me oddpepes@gmail.com).

- we will see if we can rig it up to be successful, everything is some kind of formula in this mathemagical universe.  IÂ´m confident once it goes its going to go good, but its constantly refactoring itself.

the basic idea was

- create a collectors card deck like pokemon where rarity determines the cards power, but of pepe cards.  theres a long internet phenomenon of finding the rarest pepes on the internet, because theres pepes out in the far corners of the internet and many are unique and can be anything really.  the real value is the perceived rarity.  

- making the deck was fairly easy and fun.  the hard part was giving the cards some kind of power.  and rarity.  and making them actually do something.  so I made a staking contract and made various tiers of staking rewards and it wasnt that hard to do.  but i had just never thought of it before nor have I seen it like oddpepes is implementing tiered rewards.  Im sure its out there.  just found it novel.

- and I rigged it up to fit my vision, of how you are a kid going to the store and buying a pack of 3 cards not knowing whats inside, hoping for the michael jordan rookie.  and we more or less accomplished it.  and now yeah this github is just used to host various components being used in the UI.  iÂ´m fully self taught on everything so probably unorthodox in some or many ways, im pretty much a solo dev, no doubt need help and guidance ha but humans arent as good as ai at explaining things thoroughly and infinitely.  I am sure theres always ways to improve my code though.  ai is interesting because it opens up doors and avenues to new fields fast.  the high rate of change and instability dev environment is alot at first, but eventually it all becomes formulaic.  problems come, inevitably, but ideally all things are done right and no bugs. 
 but always troubleshooting until bugs are squashed then moving forward.  its become my way of life.  we started casually building this project about 4 months ago and its nice to see it finally launched.

- its experimental, so invest wisely and realize its a high risk investment in the cryptocurrency space.  more than anything its a demo of new technologies.  and it costs $20 to really see it happen.

- other than that.  if anyone has any questions or feedback or whatever- IÂ´m usually swamped but i will try to check the oddpepes@gmail.com

- honestly, I need tons of help polishing this thing.  its just a skeleton at this point.  I need fancy elegant UI, rebranding, i need a good FAQ.  theres alot left to dial in and add.  any initial success would open opportunities for oddpepes to hire some pros to come and rig me up right

- then my ultimate goal is for pepe to have a life of his own and burn all keys and renounce ownership and let pepe be autonomous with its own DAO.  which seems to be the way of most idealist crypto projects.  btw im totally an opensource minded person and anyone curious how i did anything just lmk im an open book.  i could prob teach everything im doing in like two weeks if you have a basic background.


- anyway.  this is my github for various experimental features.  once the project is finished it should be completely decentralized and immortal, I basically need to put all components in the ether and then burn all keys and transfer governance custody to the OP DAO.  

- all metadata is upgradeable, so we can always change like pretty much everything about everything if we improve the cards are discover ways to evolve the scenario in a novel way.  the only thing unchangeable will be the staking rewards of each specific NFT ID.  so yeah oddpepes could become odd bananas in the future who really knows.  i dont plan on changing it but the OP DAO will have that ability

- after OP DAO is set up i will remain present but will move on to other projects I want to finish

- anyway, its been fun, and glad we had the Eclipse Launch.  we havent made the announcements yet 4 days later because I have been trying to get the website a little more stable and good.

- we have pepe radio which is quite novel.  so much going on for sure, but it will get better

ok thats about it, thanks for participating in my project here, I hope all enjoy their time, it was alot of work, but a labor of love.  see you down the pepe hole
